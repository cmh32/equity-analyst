-   Why is the macro agent only searching for "Microsoft Corp EU antitrust investigation 2025." Some example it's

To do: 
-   Get the app to display the full list of agents

To run the full application (both the Python backend API and the JavaScript frontend) locally:                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                                    
  1. Start the Python Backend API:                                                                                                                                                  
  This will run your AI agents and expose them via a REST endpoint.                                                                                                                 
   * Make sure you are in the root directory of your project (/Users/colinhughes/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Yale/LLM/Equity_Analyst/).                            
   * Run the following command:                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                    
   1     nohup python -m uvicorn src.api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 > api.out 2> api.err &                                                                                      
      This command starts the FastAPI server in the background on http://localhost:8000. api.out and api.err files will contain its logs.                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                    
  2. Start the JavaScript Frontend Web Server:                                                                                                                                      
  This will serve the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for your user interface.                                                                                                      
   * Make sure you are in the root directory of your project.                                                                                                                       
   * Run the following command:                                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                    
   1     nohup python -m http.server 5500 --directory frontend-web > frontend.out 2> frontend.err &                                                                                 
      This command starts a simple web server in the background on http://localhost:5500, serving the contents of the frontend-web folder. frontend.out and frontend.err files will 
  contain its logs.                                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                    
  After running both commands, open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5500` to access the frontend.
